# ASMoDeus
 ASteroid Mining Drone (Unity test project)

WIP!
The idea is maneuvering inside caves of asteroids with super heavy cores to mine crystals while avoiding running out of fuel, bumping into things too much, getting stuck near the core and/or getting crushed by the intense pressure near the core. Preferably the mining of crystals wouold be with some sort of tool, not just bumping
into them as you'll have to for now. (The little blue rods are supposed to be crystals.)
Also, the maneuverability needs A LOT of tweaking to be fun...

ARROW KEYS to control thrusters.

Hold LEFT ALT to 'strafe' with LEFT and RIGHT ARROW KEYS.

DOWN ARROW KEY brakes all velocity.

Hold SHIFT to boost thrusters. (For the moment needed just to get off the launch pad because the asteroid core is super heavy. But don't worry, the launch pad will be moved eventually.)

At the moment the only way to die (and leave the level) is to run out of fuel so if you get stuck to the core you can do that,
but of course it doesn't really give you anything besides letting you start over.
